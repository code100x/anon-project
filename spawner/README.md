## Convert WebRTC Stream to MPEG2 Stream

Follow these steps to convert the WebRTC stream into an MPEG2 stream using Unreal Media Server and save the video locally:

### Step 1: Unreal Media Server Setup
1. [Download](http://umediaserver.net/umediaserver/download.html) and install Unreal Media Server.
2. Configure Unreal Media Server as per the tutorial:
[WebRTC to FFmpeg Guide](http://umediaserver.net/umediaserver/webrtctoffmpeg.htm).
3. Use the following values during configuration:
- Alias: webrtctest
- WebRTC Password: 12345
- Ip address and port for MPEG2 broadcasting : 127.0.0.1:2000
4. Start the Unreal Media Server and ensure it's running correctly.

### Step 2: Save Video Locally with FFmpeg
1. [Download](https://www.ffmpeg.org/download.html) and install FFmpeg on your local machine.
2. Open a terminal and navigate to the directory where you want to store the video.
3. Run the following command to save the video stream locally:
```bash
ffmpeg -i udp://127.0.0.1:2000 -c:v libx264 Desktop\ffmpeg\outputfinal.mp4
```
- Replace Desktop\ffmpeg\outputfinal.mp4 with your desired output file path.

### Step 3: Verify the Video
1. Check the output file at the specified location.
2. Ensure the video plays correctly.
